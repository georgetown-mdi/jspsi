/**
 * Thrown by {@link FileSyncConnection} when the caller has supplied an
 * invalid configuration or attempted an operation that violates usage
 * constraints: wrong directory state, stale handshake files, multiple
 * concurrent sessions sharing a path, or a send timeout. This is the
 * public API contract for the 64-vs-69 exit-code split: callers outside
 * `packages/core` -- notably the CLI -- check `instanceof UsageError` to
 * distinguish a configuration problem from a transport failure and exit
 * with 64 (EX_USAGE) rather than 69 (EX_UNAVAILABLE). Future throw sites
 * added to `synchronize()` or `send()` should throw this class rather
 * than a plain `Error` with `{ cause: "usage" }`.
